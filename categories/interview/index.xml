      <description>Foreword I may not be the most experienced developer who takes care of recruitment process. At the same time the experience I have gained so far makes me a good source of information about conducting and attending interviews. Please, keep in mind that this article is written from the perspective of developer and not a recruiter before reading any further.
Note: I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to bring any specific programming language to this post as I strongly believe what I am going to talk about applies to all of the languages.</description>
