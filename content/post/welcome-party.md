#### Introduction
Hey,

Nice to meet you, reader! As of the moment I am writing this post I have been a backend developer for 4 years already. Back in the day I used to develop a blog, however it was more of an personal blog than anything else. Moreover it was written entirely in polish which, since I already moved away from Poland, wouldn't be too beneficial for my readers.

#### What is this blog about
About developer lags. There are moments in your life as a dev when you need to sit down, perhaps write something down before throwing yourself into coding again. I always called those the dev lags. A lot of the beneficial ones have already been lost, hopefully this blog will save the rest of them.

#### What can you expect:
- tutorials, related to backend development, answers to less obvious programming questions
- felietons, articles from the viewpoint of a developer, touching non-technical aspect of the profession
- blogposts, my experiences from meetups, conferences, or simply articles which I wouldn't call felietons
